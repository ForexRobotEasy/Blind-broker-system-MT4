## Code Overview
The code consists of a main function `OnTick()` which serves as the entry point for the trading robot. The code also includes several supporting functions to store trading orders, check execution time, send market order requests, execute trading plans, and clear stored trading orders.

### Main Function - `OnTick()`
This function is executed by the trading robot and performs the following steps:
1. Stores trading orders in the program's memory using the `StoreTradingOrders()` function.
2. Checks if it is the exact moment of execution by calling the `IsExecutionTime()` function.
3. If it is the execution time, it performs the following actions:
    - Sends market order requests to the broker using the `SendMarketOrderRequests()` function.
    - Executes the trading plans using the `ExecuteTradingPlans()` function.
    - Clears the stored trading orders using the `ClearTradingOrders()` function.

### Supporting Functions
The code includes several supporting functions:

1. `StoreTradingOrders()`: This function is responsible for storing trading orders within the program's memory. The specific implementation of this function is not provided in the code.

2. `IsExecutionTime()`: This function checks if it is the exact moment of execution. The specific implementation of this function is not provided in the code, and it returns a default value of `true`. Developers are expected to replace the return statement with their own logic to determine the execution time.

3. `SendMarketOrderRequests()`: This function sends market order requests to the broker. The specific implementation of this function is not provided in the code.
